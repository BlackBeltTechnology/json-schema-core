/**
 * Implementation of JSON Patch
 *
 * <p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-patch-10">JSON
 * Patch</a>, as its name implies, is an IETF draft describing a mechanism to
 * apply a patch to any JSON value. This implementation covers all operations
 * according to the specification; however, there are some subtle differences
 * with regards to some operations which are covered in these operations'
 * respective documentation.</p>
 *
 * <p>An example of a JSON Patch is as follows:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [
 *         {
 *             "op": "add",
 *             "path": "/-",
 *             "value": {
 *                 "productId": 19,
 *                 "name": "Duvel",
 *                 "type": "beer"
 *             }
 *         }
 *     ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This patch contains a single operation which adds an item at the end of
 * an array. A JSON Patch can contain more than one operation; in this case, all
 * operations are applied to the input JSON value in their order of appearance,
 * until all operations are applied or an error condition is encountered.</p>
 *
 * <p>The main point where this implementation differs from the specification
 * is initial JSON parsing. The draft says:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Operation objects MUST have exactly one "op" member
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>and:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Additionally, operation objects MUST have exactly one "path" member.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>However, obeying these to the letter forces constraints on the JSON
 * <b>parser</b>. Here, these constraints are not enforced, which means:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [ { "op": "add", "op": "remove", "path": "/x" } ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>is parsed (as a {@code remove} operation, since it appears last).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> the JSON Patch is supposed to be VALID when the
 * constructor for this class ({@link JsonPatch#fromJson(JsonNode)} is used.</p>
