    <title>JSON Schema core utilities</title>

<h1>What this is</h1>

<p>This package provides an infrastructure to chain individual units of work
(processors) together in order to produce arbitrarily complex processing chains.
The provided infrastructure is complete with processing messages, reports and
dedicated exceptions.</p>

<p>In addition, it also provides a basic set of structures to work with JSON in
general, and JSON Schema in particular: trees and schema trees, JSON Reference
and JSON Pointer, schema syntax validation and schema walking (with associated
listeners and processors), schema loading.</p>

<h1>Processors</h1>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>A {@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.processing.Processor} is a base unit of
work. Its concept is pretty simple: it accepts an input as an argument and
produces an output.</p>

<p>For reporting purposes, it also has a {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.report.ProcessingReport} as an argument, to which you
can log messages.</p>

<p>All the processing infrastructure is in the following package: {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.processing}.</p>

<h2>Combining processors</h2>

<p>You can combine processors in several ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the first way is chaining them: as long as the output of a processor is
    compatible with another, you can create a processor which is the result of
    combining these two processors (of course, you are not limited to two);
    </li>
    <li>the second way is creating selectors; two selectors exist: a map-based
    selector (which requires that you extract a key suitable for use in a map)
    and a much more versatile, but more complex, predicate selector.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can therefore create arbitrarily complex chains. And, last but not least,
you also have the ability to transparently cache the results of a processor if
the computation is expensive, for future reuse -- not only that, but you can
also provide an {@link com.google.common.base.Equivalence} on inputs to reduce
the set of inputs cached.</p>

<h1>Reporting/logging</h1>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>The two basic components of the reporting/logging infrastructure are {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.report.ProcessingReport} and {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.report.ProcessingMessage}.</p>

<p>The existing infrastructure allows you to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>have full control over what is being logged, and how;</li>
    <li>customize exceptions and log messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the logging infrastructure is in the following package: {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.report}.</p>

<h2>Reports</h2>

<p>A processing report has a classical set of logging methods, which names will
be familiar to anyone having used a logging API: {@code debug()}, {@code
info()}, {@code warn()} and {@code error()}. You can customize what log levels
are effectively logged, but also from what level exceptions are thrown instead.
</p>

<p>As {@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.report.ProcessingReport} is an interface,
you can actually use a logging system for your messages -- or even log messages
at different levels differently; however, be aware that the contract is rather
strict (but it is documented), and as such you may prefer to extend {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.report.AbstractProcessingReport} instead.</p>

<p>This package comes with three implementations built in: {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.report.ConsoleProcessingReport} (which logs to the
standard output), {@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.report.ListProcessingReport}
(which accumulates messages in a list} and {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.report.DevNullProcessingReport} (which discards all
messages but keeps track of the processing status).</p>

<h2>Messages</h2>

<p>Messages have one main source: processor inputs. You will have noticed that
both inputs and outputs are required to implement the {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.report.MessageProvider} interface: this allows
reporting message templates to be generated out of an input and, as such, helps
greatly in identifying what the source of the message is, and therefore at what
step in the processing this message has been issued.</p>

<p>Another customization of logging messages is exception generation: when the
message is logged at a level which raises an exception rather than being
purely logged, {@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.report.AbstractProcessingReport}
does not {@code throw} per se, but calls this message's {@code .asException()}
instead. If you have customized the processing message with a specific exception
provider, this means your custom exception will be thrown rather than the
standard {@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.exceptions.ProcessingException}.</p>

<h1>JSON Reference and JSON Pointer</h1>

<h2>JSON Reference</h2>

<p>This package allows to build JSON References from string inputs or {@link
java.net.URI} instances. You can also resolve one reference against another and
obtain the fragment part (if the JSON Reference is legal) as a JSON Pointer.</p>

<p>The main use of this package in the core is to materialize URI contexts in
JSON Schema instances. A special form (non URI compliant) of reference exists
to be able to handle {@code jar} URIs as well.</p>

<p>All JSON Reference related classes are in the following package: {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.ref}.</p>

<h2>JSON Pointer</h2>

<p>You can use JSON Pointer to navigate through JSON documents, and this package
has full support for this. While the mostly used class will be {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.jsonpointer.JsonPointer} itself, the code is generic
enough that it can adapt to any {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.core.TreeNode}
instance.</p>

<p>See the different classes in {@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.tree} for
examples of how JSON Pointer is used.</p>

<p>All JSON Pointer related classes are in the following package: {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.jsonpointer}.</p>

<h2>Schema loading</h2>

<p>Classes in the {@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.load} package serve several
purposes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>preloading schemas;</li>
    <li>adding and/or removing support for various URI schemes;</li>
    <li>JSON Reference resolving.</li>
</ul>

<p>All aspects of schema loading are controlled via a {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.load.configuration.LoadingConfiguration} instance.</p>

<h1>Other utilities</h1>

<p>Many other utilities exist in this package. This lists the most important of
them.</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>This package has a set of both checked and unchecked exceptions. Checked
exceptions are all subclasses of {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.exceptions.ProcessingException}, while unchecked
exceptions are subclasses of {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.exceptions.unchecked.ProcessingError}.</p>

<p>Unchecked exceptions are thrown when a misconfiguration occurs, therefore
always before the processing actually takes place. This mostly occurs when
a null input is provided to methods which do not accept it, and prevents {@link
java.lang.NullPointerException}s to be thrown when processing.</p>

<p>All the exception infrastructure is in the following package: {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.exceptions}.</p>

<h2>Important JSON Schema related utilities</h2>

<p>This package provides five important utility classes for JSON Schema usage:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>{@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.util.JacksonUtils} provides a reader
    and node factory with customized configuration; in particular, all decimal
    number instances are read as {@link java.math.BigDecimal} to prevent loss
    of precision during computations;</li>
    <li>{@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.util.JsonLoader} allows to load JSON
    content from various sources, and makes use of the reader above;</li>
    <li>{@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.util.NodeType} allows to determine
    the type of a JSON value according to the JSON Schema definition;</li>
    <li>{@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.util.RhinoHelper} allows to check the
    validity of, and use regexes using, ECMA 262, as required by the JSON Schema
    specification;</li>
    <li>{@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.util.equivalence.JsonSchemaEquivalence}
    allows equality comparison of two JSON values (however complex) according to
    the JSON Schema definition of equality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Freeze/thaw</h2>

<p>The two interfaces, {@link com.github.fge.jsonschema.util.Frozen} and {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.util.Thawed}, provide a contract whereby any frozen
value may provide a "thawed", mutable version of itself, and any thawed value
may provide a "frozen", immutable version of itself.</p>

<p>json-schema-validator makes heavy use of this paradigm -- and this is the
main reason why it is thread safe: all processors use immutable, frozen
instances at initialization time.</p>

<p>In this package, one utility class uses this paradigm: {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.library.Dictionary} (frozen) and {@link
com.github.fge.jsonschema.library.DictionaryBuilder} (thawed).</p>
